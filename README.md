GIT STATUS

GIT ADD 

GIT COMMIT -m

GIT PUSH - u origin main pushes changes to the main branch / --set-upstream ensures we are pushing to the same branch

There are different branches if you create them allowing for more specific project control and a multi-person approach

change on git 

GIT is a CVS which tracks changes to a project, each person gets their own workiing copy after pulling a version from the Repo. The above commands are the steps to uploading to git. When deling with git in a team setting git can also merge 

git checkout -b makes a new branch
git branch - a lists All branches

If all else fails email yourself the ctrl+A, ctrl+V text of any changes you made.
